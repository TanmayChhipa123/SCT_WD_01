    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This landing page is part of Task 01 from SkillCraft Technology. The goal was to create a responsive design with a fixed-position navigation bar that changes style when hovered or when scrolling down the page. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, styling, and responsive layout techniques.</p>
